Here’s your updated README.md, refined and structured for clarity:

# BenPavey Portfolio Test Suite

This repository contains a Playwright test suite to validate the functionality, usability, and performance of the [benpavey.com](https://benpavey.com) portfolio website. The site is built with Django (minimal Python code) alongside HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

## ** Automated Testing with GitHub Actions**

This test suite is **automated** via **GitHub Actions**, providing:
- **On-Demand Testing** → Runs on every push to `main` for immediate feedback.
- **Scheduled Testing** → Runs **every Tuesday at 10:30 AM UTC** to detect regressions.
- **Test Reports** → Generated and uploaded as artifacts for review.
- **Issue Notifications** → GitHub issues are created upon test success/failure.

**Test Reports:**  
Latest test reports are available in [GitHub Actions](../../actions) or via GitHub Pages.
